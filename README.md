This repo is a work in progress to enhance component install using Bower.

In addition to compiling for single use for anamations LESS is being used to comment out code blocks that are not needed other than the core css.

I am also including files to build out page using Bootstrap Material Design. Using my repo `https://github.com/Gregory-Phillips/bootstrap-material-design.git` that I have forked `https://github.com/FezVrasta/bootstrap-material-design.git`
